hello!

most of this work I did outside of github then uploaded upon completion, the data is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/intandea/1-billboard-music-chart-2019-till-aug-2020)
for further information/analysis, here is a link to the google doc our group wrote (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1djoKO11D7NM8JaDutbWUs74TBvidqY8djIMsGKQ4E8U/edit?usp=sharing).

with the exception of the tableau map visualizations, i performed all data cleaning and visualization preparation for this project. all the code shown is written (and commented) by me.
